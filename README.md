# Cpplearningressource
A collection of very simple examples of C++ 14 code, demonstrating essential concepts, basics, OOP, datastructures, multithreading, and others.

C++ Starter code for beginner and junior developpers

What is this ?

This is a collection of  simple code samples that cover the main C ++ 14 concepts a programmer should be aware of.
These code samples are heavily commented and each is kept as simple and naive as possible. 
They are aimed at beginner, junior developpers, or simply anyone who wants a collection of examples that can be ran, read, and understood, in the shortest amount of time possible.
The examples given in this git should cover most of  the really basic concepts in their simplest and most naive form a C++ 14 programmer should know.

How should I use this ?

If you don't know how to use some of the concepts listed in this git, use these examples to understand and master them. 
If you know all of these concepts, you can use these examples as a refresher or to kickstart that project you are actually coding by using a functional example.
The concept name is in the file, so if you want for example to run a multithreading sample, compile one of the multithreading(something).cpp files.
Note : Make sure that you have a C++ 14 capable compiler. If you don't have any, download a Microsoft VCC copy.

What about C++ 17 and 20 concepts?

While some companies request the most recent standards (C++ 17 and 20), they usually consider that a programmer with a solid knowledge of C++14 can become up to date with their standards rather quickly. 

What basic C++ concepts are covered in this git ?

basics :
var&loops.cpp
casts.cpp
Exceptions.cpp
lambdas, capture.cpp
logical operations â€“ bitwise.cpp
recursive.cpp (include tail recursivity)

OOP (object oriented programming) related :
OOP access compatibility.cpp
OOP classes v. structs, inheritance, static, single use objects, diamond problem.cpp
OOP operator overload.cpp
OOP virtual, interface.cpp

data structures :
vectors, lists, differences.cpp
sets, maps, unordered_set_ unordered_map, & use of iterator.cpp

memory related :
(include release)
raw pointers.cpp
unique pointers.cpp
shared and weak pointers.cpp

C++ 11 / 14 related :
move semantics.cpp
templates.cpp
multithreading :
multithread join detach.cpp
multithread, mutex, manual and scoped locks.cpp
